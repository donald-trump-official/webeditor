# Web Breadboard Editor (SPA)

## Introduction

This is a simple demo for our web circuit editor. We made this to verify if our design works.

## Install and Run

After cloning the repository, you first need to install all the dependencies. Enter the project directory and run:

```shell
$ npm install -s
```

You may install these packages with a proxy software on or use`cnpm install -s` instead.

To start the development server, run:

```shell
$ npm start
```

Visit `localhost:3000` with browser to preview the project.
